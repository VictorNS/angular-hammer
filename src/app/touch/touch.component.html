<h1>
  Angular touch events
</h1>
<h3>
  We don't use HammerJS for this page!
</h3>
<h3>
  The DIV catches touch events via directive.
</h3>
<p>
  You need to open the developer tools and turn on the touch emulation.
</p>
<p>
  In this example we prevent a scroll event by <i>ev.preventDefault();</i> and change a scroll position manually.
</p>
<p>
  Also in the directive we manually throw <i>Click</i> event, because we prevent native events.
</p>

<div appToucher class="outer">
  <div class="item" *ngFor="let i of numbers" (click)="onClick(i)">{{i}}</div>
</div>
